# Plex Logger
This program uses the Python Plex API and discord.py to watch a specified Plex server for periodic changes, and generate changelogs to be sent via Discord or printed to a text file.

Anything in 'notes.txt' will be added to the top of the upcoming changelog, and then the 'notes.txt' file's contents will be cleared.
